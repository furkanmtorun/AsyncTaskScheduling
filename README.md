## ðŸ’¡ TL;DR: What is this at all?
Together with advancements in computing capacity and increasing trend in working on the large scale datasets, in some projects, we might need to execute time-consuming and/or heavy functions upon the plenty of requests coming from the client side.

So, we shall to run them in background while still getting new requests from the client and finally, we should get back the result later once the process is done. 

Hence, here, asynchronous (async) task scheduling via microservices provide an well offer to handle our issue!

## ðŸ§ª What are async tasks and microservices?
TBA

## ðŸ’­ Use cases (aka. Real-life examples)
Maybe you might asking why we need this or what are the real-life examples? Actually, currently, several processes are going through in async way even we do not realize. 

**Here are the some cases:**

    # In the project folder for REST-API
