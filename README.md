## ðŸ’¡ TL;DR: What is this at all?
Together with advancements in computing capacity and increasing trend in working on the large scale datasets, in some projects, we might need to execute time-consuming and/or heavy functions upon the plenty of requests coming from the client side.

So, we shall to run them in background while still getting new requests from the client and finally, we should get back the result later once the process is done. 

Hence, here, asynchronous (`async`) task scheduling via microservices provide an well offer to handle our issue!

## ðŸ§ª What are async tasks and microservices?

**Microservices**

During designing a sofware pipeline, **Microservices Architecture**, where the applications, modules/functions work independently, has showed up for the last decade.

![Monolithic vs Microservice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49681382/116817414-e617be00-ab6e-11eb-977a-3991cb4703b8.jpg)

In microservices architecture, contast to monolithic architecture, the functional parts of your whole work are splitted into smaller units. Those smaller units are dedicated to work on a specific tasks and they do their job well!

While working they do not really know what the others perform however they have a common port/way of communication where they are able to talk to each other.

**Asynchronous (async) Programming**  

Let's get start with synchronous one. In this case, the tasks or the jobs are performed once at a time. So, to be able to work on the 2nd (following) task, first of all, 1st (previous) task has to be completed. So, you have to wait for a task to complete to go for the next one.

By contrast, in async programming, the pipeline can go with any process without waiting for completion of previous task if they are independent from each other. Hence, you might catch several requests at a time simulatenously.

## ðŸ’­ Use cases (aka. Real-life examples)
Maybe you might asking why we need this or what are the real-life examples? Actually, currently, several processes are going through in async way even we do not realize.

    <p><br>Assume that you are starving and looking forward to eating a burger! <br><br>
    In this scenario, every customer is getting  reference number after their ordering. While the order is on its own way, the customers can just relax and control the dashboard for the status of their orders while the crew are working on other orders.

    <summary>Use case #2 | Basic example</summary>
    <p><br>Think that we as a team or company are providing a form in our web page to our users or customers and they can fill the form. Supposing that we need a sort of computation which takes a lot of time once the form is filled. 
    <br></p>
    <img src="http://brunorocha.org/static/media/microservices/micro_services.png">
    <br><p> Now, in this scenario, our user will fill and submit the form, we will return that "OK, we got your request and will let you know". Meanwhile, we will perform needed calculation in background and once it's done, we will send an email containing the result of calculation to our user. Yey! <br><br>
    For this real-life example, you can find <a href="http://brunorocha.org/python/microservices-with-python-rabbitmq-and-nameko.html">another repository and blog with its implementation here</a>.

    <p>Almost same protocol also applies here. Consider that our user is willing to predict the 3D structure of a protein with given sequence or post long-time genome alignment work. <br><br>
    So, while you might get other request from same person and/or other users, the tasks will undergo the pipeline in the background and will turn back once they are done, if possible ðŸ˜Š. </p>

## ðŸŽ¨ Architecture of the pipeline

Here is the schematic view of my pipeline:

**Technologies used:**

| Name | Description | Link |
|-|-|-|
| Flask | Python micro web-framework | https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/ |
| Flask-RESTPlus | Extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs | https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ |
| Celery | Asynchronous task queue or job queue package for Python | https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/ |
| Flower | Tool for monitoring and administrating Celery clusters | https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ |
| Redis | In-memory data structure store, a distributed, keyâ€“value database | https://redis.io/ |

## ðŸ§µ Installation & Running

Here is classic way of installation and running.
> Docker-compose file might come later!

**Installation**

- Install Redis:
  - Visit offical document here: https://redis.io/topics/quickstart.
  - If you are using Win10, you might check here: https://dev.to/divshekhar/how-to-install-redis-on-windows-10-3e99.
- To install the required packages:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Running**

- Start redis:
    
    `redis-server --port 6380 --slaveof 127.0.0.1 6379`

- Execute `Celery`, `Flower` and our `flask_api` file inside the project folder:
  
    - `celery worker -A flask_api.celery_client -E`

        > If you are using Win10 and face some problems with Celery, try the following insted:

        `celery worker -A flask_api.celery_client -E --pool=solo -l info`

    - `flower -A flask_api.celery_client`

        > Then, you can visit http://localhost:5555/

    - `python flask_api.py`

        > Now, time to open our REST-Api on http://localhost:5000/
<br>

## ðŸ’Ž How the things go (aka. Results)?

In our simple pipeline, we provide a REST API for our user where they can calculate the body-mass index (bmi) of a person. So, they can list all of the calculations or post a new one under the end point namely `calculationsEP Operations for Calculations` while they can get the details of a calculation using unique process ID `pid` or delete it via `pid`. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49681382/116817566-a1d8ed80-ab6f-11eb-8054-9121efab4a48.png" alt="page-overview"> 

_Our Flask RESTPlus API page overview_


Here, in our case, `bmi_calculation()` function mimics a time-consuming process. Once the user submit a new entry with `name`, `weight` and `height`, it automatically add this request to query via message broker or queue system Redis and it sends to Celery workers to be processed and it returns a unique `pid`. Once the result is ready, it is saved into MongoDB Atlas database to operate CRUD operations on the API (getting the list of calculations, deleting etc.).

        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49681382/116817958-85d64b80-ab71-11eb-97df-ed8f527cfedf.png" alt="Screenshot_4">
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49681382/116817959-85d64b80-ab71-11eb-8a0b-a729f5e9dfb2.png" alt="Screenshot_5">

    </p>
</details><br>

So, now, our users can fetch easily the calculated bmi values (in background) by using given `pid` later time.

That's all for now!
