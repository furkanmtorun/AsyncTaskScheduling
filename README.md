## ðŸ’¡ TL;DR: What is this at all?
Together with advancements in computing capacity and increasing trend in working on the large scale datasets, in some projects, we might need to execute time-consuming and/or heavy functions upon the plenty of requests coming from the client side.

So, we shall to run them in background while still getting new requests from the client and finally, we should get back the result later once the process is done. 

Hence, here, asynchronous (`async`) task scheduling via microservices provide an well offer to handle our issue!

## ðŸ§ª What are async tasks and microservices?

> Microservices

During designing a sofware pipeline, **Microservice Architecture**, where the applications, modules/functions work independently, has showed up for the last decade.

In this way, contast to monolithic architecture, the functional parts of your whole work are splitted into smaller units. Those smaller units are dedicated to work on a specific tasks and they do their job well! 
While working they do not really know what the others perform however they have a common port/way of communication where they are able to talk to each other.

## ðŸ’­ Use cases (aka. Real-life examples)
Maybe you might asking why we need this or what are the real-life examples? Actually, currently, several processes are going through in async way even we do not realize. 

**Here are the some real-life examples:** 

_If you have more (and/or clearer) examples, please just [reach me out](#-author--feedbackcontribution)._

    <summary>Use case #1 | Ordering a burger | <b>Literally real-life</b> ðŸ˜Š</summary>
    <p><br>Assume that you are starving and looking forward to eating a burger! <br><br>
    In this scenario, every customer is getting  reference number after their ordering. While the order is on its own way, the customers can just relax and control the dashboard for the status of their orders while the crew are working on other orders.

    <summary>Use case #2 | Basic example</summary>
    <p>Think that we as a team or company are providing a form in our web page to our users or customers and they can fill the form. Supposing that we need a sort of computation which takes a lot of time once the form is filled. 
    <br></p>
    <img src="http://brunorocha.org/static/media/microservices/micro_services.png">
    <br><p> Now, in this scenario, our user will fill and submit the form, we will return that "OK, we got your request and will let you know". Meanwhile, we will perform needed calculation in background and once it's done, we will send an email containing the result of calculation to our user. Yey! <br><br>
    For this real-life example, you can find another repository and blog with its implementation <a href="http://brunorocha.org/python/microservices-with-python-rabbitmq-and-nameko.html">here</a>.
